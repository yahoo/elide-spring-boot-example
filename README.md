An archetype Elide project using Spring Boot

[![Build Status](https://cd.screwdriver.cd/pipelines/7924/badge)](https://cd.screwdriver.cd/pipelines/7924)

## Background

This project is the sample code for [Elide's Getting Started documentation](https://elide.io/pages/guide/01-start.html).

1. Build Docker Image from Root of the project 
   ```
   docker build -t elide/elide-spring-boot-example .
   ```
2. Run docker container locally
   ```
   docker run -p 8081:8080 -d elide/elide-spring-boot-example
   ```
3. Application should be running in 
   ```
   http://localhost:8081/
   ```
   
3. Check Docker containers running
   ```
   docker ps
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                             COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                     NAMES

   docker logs -f 99998a35d377 
   ```

5. If you want to ssh to your docker container for more troubleshooting
   ```
    docker exec -it 99998a35d377 /bin/sh
   ```
# Run from cloud (AWS)


1. ECR 
   1. Create a repository in Elastic Container Registry with name elide-spring-boot-example
   2. aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin xxx.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com 
   3. docker tag elide-spring-boot-example:latest xxx.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/elide-spring-boot-example:latest
   4. docker push xxx.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/elide-spring-boot-example
2. Fargate
   1. With the image on AWS ECR, you can now define your deployment on AWS ECS/Fargate.
   2. Make sure to mention ECR details
   3. Port mapping is needed in the task definition. If you open the json definition of the task, you can edit to add this.
   "portMappings": [
         {
         "hostPort": 8080,
         "protocol": "tcp",
         "containerPort": 8080
         }
      ],
    4. The security group created or used for the task , needs to have inbound rule for TCP custom port 8080 , CIDR block 0.0.0.0/0(open to everyone, or you can add your company's CIDR block if its an internal service)
